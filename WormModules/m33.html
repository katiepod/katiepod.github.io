<h2> Module 33 </h2>
<hr />
<h4>
Hemi-module gene counts:
</h4>  
 
<p><a href="#up_genes">1201 probesets</a> in positive hemi-module.<br /> <a href="#dn_genes">1182 probesets</a> in negative hemi-module.<br /> Note: While the mapping of probesets to genes is generally one-to-one, some probesets map to multiple genes and some do not map to any genes (i.e., the region of the genome they match is no longer considered genic).</p>
<hr />
<h4>
Contrast SVE:
</h4>  
<p>Signed variance explained (SVE) provides an indication of how similar a set of fold changes are to a gene module’s weight vector. An SVE value of 0.3, for example, indicates that 30% of the variance explained by the entire module set is accounted for the module in question. Shown here are the SVE values for this module accross a compendium of fold changes (contrasts). Extreme SVE values (e.g., &gt; 0.05) indicate that those contrasts specifically induce (orange dots) or specifically repress (blue dots) this module. Examining the experimental conditions being compared in such contrasts (see tables below the figure) may provide insight into the gene module’s function.<br /><img

<h4>
Contrast SVE, Up-Regulated Genes Only:
</h4>  
<p>Calculating SVE for up-regulated and down-regulated genes separately may be more informative in many cases than projecting the up- and down- gene sets together. This is due to the fact that the weight distribution of many modules is highly skewed, indicating that only one of the hemi-modules may be biologically meaningful (i.e., a set of genes are strongly correlated buy only a few genes (or none) are strongly anti-correlated to that set.)<br /><img

GO Term Enrichment:
</h4>  
This analysis tests each hemi-module for enrichment of specific GO terms. Only gene-level annotations (e.g., as would be found on the gene’s page in Wormbase) are tested - the hiearchical structure of the GO ontology is not taken into account. Negative enrichment scores indicate fewer hemi-module genes than expected by random chance were assiciated with the GO term in question.<br />
<h5>
Significant GO terms: Positive hemi-module
</h5>  
<p>No significant annotations.</p>

<h4>
REACTOME Pathway Enrichment:
</h4>  
This analysis tests each hemi-module for enrichment of REACTOME pathways (n.b., the term ‘pathway’ is used very loosely by REACTOME, and can be something as small as a single biochemical reaction or even a macromolecular complex.) This analysis was performed using an old version of REACTOME, and they have since changed their ID scheme. Thus, the links to the REACTOME database are non-functional at present (but more info for a pathway can be found by searching for the pathway definition at <a href="http://www.reactome.org">http://www.reactome.org</a>) Negative enrichment scores indicate fewer hemi-module genes than expected by random chance were associated with the pathway in question.<br />
<h5>
Significant REACTOME pathways: Positive hemi-module
</h5>  
<p>No significant annotations.</p>
<h5>
Significant REACTOME pathways: Negative hemi-module

This analysis tests each hemi-module for enrichment of genes associated with specific tissues. Negative enrichment scores indicate fewer hemi-module genes than expected by random chance were assiciated with the tissue in question.<br />
<h5>
Significant Enriched tissues: Positive hemi-module
</h5>  
<p>No significant annotations.</p>

<h4>
Promoter Word Enrichment:
</h4>  
This analysis tests each hemi-module for enrichment of specific promoter words. The list of promoter words tested was generated by running the MobyDick algorithm (see PMID:10944202) on the full set of <em>C. elegans</em> 2 Kbp promoters. Negative enrichment scores indicate fewer hemi-module genes than expected by random chance were associated with the word in question.<br />
